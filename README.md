# Advent_of_code_2022

Intending to participate in the Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com/) this year. If you look at my solutions you may notice that I am not necessarily going for simplicity all the time. Just for the sake of exercising more features of golang you might find some completely unnecessary usage of various parts of the language. 
Like using concurrency, reflection, Goroutines etc when not truly needed.
